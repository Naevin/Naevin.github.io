            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              I’m an undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University studying computer science.
              I’m particularly interested in app development as I enjoy creating useful tools for
              everyday people. In the future, I hope to work as a
              software engineer at a tech or financial company.

            <h3>Software Engineering Intern at PayPal</h3>
            <p>I was fortunate enough to spend the summer of 2020 working as a software engineering intern at PayPal. I joined the Credit Platforms and Communications Team and was tasked with migrating the functionality of a legacy service to a more modern system. The legacy service I was migrating is responsible for creating, retrieving, and updating PayPal credit contracts in the UK and Germany. The implementation for this was mainly done with Java and the Spring framework. While working on this I learned lots of language specific concepts and implementation patterns. I also learned about different frameworks and technologies: Mockito, Mapstruct, Hibernate, TestNG, Maven, etc. Furthermore, I became more comfortable with working on a team of developers through things like the Jira, Jenkins, and Git.</p>
            <p>I also spent some time working on contract templates for upcoming PayPal products. I was given contracts in word documents from product and legal teams, and my job was to convert these to contract templates. These contract templates supported the dynamic fields that would be loaded from a database. The templates also included some state logic, where different legal information would be shown depending on the state in which the customer resided. This work was mostly done in HTML and FTL (Freemarker Templates). </p>

            <h3>Teaching Assistant at Johns Hopkins</h3>
            <p>
              During my Spring 2020 semester I became a TA for the Intermediate Programming course taught at Johns Hopkins. 
              As the name suggests, this class primarily focuses on intermediate programming concepts in C++: 
              pointers, dynamic memory allocation, templates, polymorphism, etc. As a TA, I participated in lectures and helped students through in-class assignments. 
              I also held office hours where I would reinforce concepts taught in class and also help guide students through written and programming assignments. 
              Furthermore, I was responsible for grading weekly assignments and attending weekly meetings discussing grading and course improvements.

            <h3>Computer Science Instructor at Juni Learning</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to being a student during the Fall of 2019 I was  working part-time as an instructor for Juni Learning. Here I
              taught
              computer science concepts in Python to K-12 students. I taught a wide range of topics like syntax,
              data
              structures, recursion, etc. I love teaching and working at Juni has allowed me to see the instructor’s
              perspective of the learning process. This has been extremely enlightening to me as I think it has improved
              my
              ability to articulate and communicate ideas to others. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to work
              at
              Juni.

            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
              Cycling: I enjoy exploring the outdoors. When I lived in Southern California, I would frequently
              go on bike trails in the Irvine Area. My longest ride was biking
              the entire San Diego Creek Trail, a round trip of about 60 miles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tennis: I have played tennis ever since I was a toddler. At certain times I have
              loved every minute of it and at other times I have wanted to quit altogether.
              I started playing competitively since the age of 8. I have also played on the USTA
              and as member of my high school team. Currently, I play for the NCAA team at Johns Hopkins University.
