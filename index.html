            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
              I’m an undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University studying computer science.
              I’m particularly interested in app development as I enjoy creating useful tools for
              everyday people. I’ve also recently begun to dig into the field of data science,
              particularly in the stock market. I’m new to coding, having only started my senior
              year of high school. To improve, I frequently work on personal projects and some of
              those can be found right here on this website. In the future, I hope to work as a
              software engineer at a tech or financial company.

            <h3>What I'm up to</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to being a student, I’m also working part-time as an instructor for Juni Learning. Here I
              teach
              computer science concepts in Python to K-12 students. I teach a wide range of topics including syntax,
              data
              structures, recursion, etc. I love teaching and working at Juni has allowed me to see the instructor’s
              perspective of the learning process. This has been extremely enlightening to me as I think it has improved
              my
              ability to articulate and communicate ideas to others. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to work
              at
              Juni.

            <h3>Summer of 2019</h3>
            <p>
              Over the summer of 2019 I was an intern for Grace Yoo’s LA city council campaign. During my time here I
              managed her website and improved its functionality. For example, I add a Mailchimp email service allowing
              people to automatically sign up to her mailing list. As a result, we now have 4000+ subscribers. I also
              automated several campaign tasks like creating walks lists, merging contact information, and scraping
              political data.

            <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
            <p>
              I was born in Seattle, Washington, but have moved around quite a lot. In fact,
              I have lived in 9 different places including Houston, Irvine, and Washington D.C.
              I’m currently living in Los Angeles for the summer, and I will be returning to Baltimore
              to resume college.

            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
              Cycling: I love exploring the outdoors. When I lived in Irvine, I would always spend
              my free time biking the trails of Southern California. My longest ride was biking
              the entire San Diego Creek Trail, a round trip of about 60 miles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tennis: I have played tennis ever since I was a toddler. At certain times I have
              loved every minute of it and at other times I have wanted to quit altogether.
              I started playing competitively since the age of 8. I have played on the USTA
              and as member of my high school team, and now I play for the NCAA team at Johns Hopkins University.
